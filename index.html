		<h2> <i> The Best of the Best </i></h2>
		<h3> The Basics </h3>
		<p> 
			The Masters is a prestigious golf tournament scheduled on the first week of April every year,
			and it sparks the beginning of major play each year.
			It is played at the same location each year, Augusta National Golf Club, 
			a private golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia. It was started 
			by Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones, who wanted to build a golf course after his 
			retirement from the game. The course first opened 84 years ago and has been 
			maintained and restructured several times. The Masters is an official 
			money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. 
			The field of players is elite in a way because the tournament is an invitational event, 
			so the field only includes the best players at the time. Players who win the Masters are
			automatically invited to play in the other three majors for the next five years and earn
			a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

			and most maintained courses in the world.

		<h3> Traditions </h3>
		<p>
			The prestigious tournament has a variety of different traditions. Since 1949,
			the champion is awarded the famous green jacket, but it is stored away on club grounds. 
			Any golfer who wins the event more than once uses the same green jacket 
			awarded upon his initial win, unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new one.
			The Champions Dinner is always held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is only
			open to previous champions and certain members of Augusta National. Legendary golfers,
			usually previous Masters Champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the 
			first round as a way to start up play. Caddies also are a part of the traditional ways of the
			Masters. The Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform of which is a white jumpsuit, a green
			Masters cap, and white tennis shoes. The defending champion always receives caddy number "1," and
			other golfers get their caddy numbers from the order in which they register for the tournament.

		<h3> The Audience </h3>
		<p>
			Tickets for the Masters are not expensive, but they are one of the rarest events
			to get tickets for. Surprisingly, practice rounds are often rare to get into as well. 
			Tickets to the actualtournament are only sold to members of a patrons list, which is now closed. 
			The waiting list for the patron list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It reopened in 
			2000 and abruptly closed soon after. The difficulty in acquiring Masters tickets has made the
			tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market. Because the patron
			list is so minuscule, a majority of the tickets are delivered to the same group of fans
			each year. For the people that cannot attend the event, CBS has televised the Masters in
			the United States every year since 1956. The club mandates minimal commercial interruption,
			so it is convenient for viewers as they do not lose much golf during the tournament.
			The tournament has also been broadcasted on WestwoodOne radio since 1956; they provide
			short updates throughout the tournament, and lengthy segments towards the end of the 
			tournament.

			Of the 80 plus years the Masters have been played, there have been 51 different champions
			of the tournament, with 34 of those having only won once. The first winner of the 
			Masters was Horton Smith in 1934. Jack Nicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six; 
			renowned Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have won four each, and five golfers
			have won three titles at the Masters. Gary Player, from South Africa, was the first
			non-American player to win the tournament in 1961.
